actions that we're taking, when we get to full realization, and i want to stress, we do believe that this will give us an opportunity to reinvest in the business and actually accelerate growth, but if you just look at the cost side of it, it's 2 to 3 points of spending as a percent of revenue when we get to mid-2017, and full realization. that takes our spending as a percent of revenue, even just based on your estimate of 2016 revenue, it's 2 to 3 points, it takes us back down into the low 30s from a spending as percent of revenue. you can do the math from there and see what we think we can achieve next year in terms of overall operating range.\n","okay, thanks for all those details. my follow-up would be the full-year guidance of mid single-digit growth. when i put that together with the high single-digit decline now that you have in the pc business, i'm having a little hard time seeing how, if you take the seasonality of pcs out of the equation, in large part, what would be the lever that would get you there in the back half of the year, considering that a ramp well into the $15 billion range in revenue seems to be a prerequisite. are there some moving parts you could describe to us that get you comfortable with that number?\n","i'm trying to see if you can be just a bit more specific on your full-year view. does the team anticipate double-digits growth in dcg? if i look at it fundamentally, cloud and hyperscale capex looks to be up this year. there seems to be a big upgrade cycle in networking with the move to 25 gigabit ethernet. you are rolling out 14 nanometer broadwell. can you just be a bit more specific on expectations for dcg growth?\n","it's iot. we've talked about iot as one of our growth segments. it grew 22% this quarter. it's clearly -- his performance in the group is strong. and he's staying until we find a successor, roughly the end of the year, we think, something like that.\n","sure. absolutely on schedule for hitting our committed $800 million, and just like last year we'll shoot to do better than that. mobile is absolutely continuing to grow for us as a segment, and we're continuing to increase our profitability. if you look underneath the numbers here, you'll see that the profitability within the mobile space continues to improve for us, this year over last year.\n","and that includes the pc, but it's much more than that. and so what this effort around the restructuring is, is to say, it's time now to try, and we've made enough progress, right? you take a look at it, 40% of our revenue, 60% of our margin comes from areas other than the pc right now. it's time to make this transition and push the company over, all the way to that strategy and that strategic direction. so that's why we wanted to do it now.\n","and blayne, just to make sure, if you look at the cfo commentary, just to make sure the financial answer is clear there, the $1.4 billion in run rate savings is a net number. so i just want to be clear on that. that's what we expect to achieve, and that is encompassing the fact, like brian said, that we'll be increasing investments in a lot of different areas.\n","thanks, just a quick follow-up on the last question on restructuring. so should we assume that total expenses will drop roughly $150 million a quarter from 4q 2016 to the second quarter of 2017? and then if you could break that out between how much of the savings would be on cogs versus opex?\n","yes, you can really see it, blayne, in the ccg operating profit. that's up over 30%, which is on roughly flat revenues, revenues were up a little bit. and when you parse out the big contributions there, there's some asp good news, but the really big chunks are the improvement in the margin on our mobile products, and decreases in investments that we talked to you about in the past that were all included in that mobile profitability. so you can, you'll see this play out in the ccg profitability over the course of this year, and you can see it in q1.\n","in terms of the overall model, the financial model for the company, i've given you this range of 55% to 65% gross margin as being -- most of the data points landing between those goal posts. if you look at it over the last five years, we've very consistently been in the very high end of that gross margin range, so it's more like between 60 and 65%. last year we were 63%. this year we believe we are at 62%, so that continues. i don't see anything on the horizon that changes that in the near term.\n","yes, and if you look at the cfo commentary, we actually gave you desktop and notebook. what you'll see is that notebook was pretty flat from an asp standpoint year-on-year. desktop was up 6%, so that is one of the [adverse] to profitability.\n","got it, thanks for those details. as a follow-up, i know you probably have answered different pieces of this question, but perhaps stacy, you could help us quantify what intel started operating margins are this year, or maybe even longer term. because when i look at a lot of fabless semiconductor companies, they can get towards 20%, 25% operating margins, and when i look at a foundry, a dsmc, it's able to get close to 40% operating margin. so given those bookends, where should intel be after all these restructuring actions are taken?\n","no, i'm not going to give that level of granularity of forecasting by quarter and 2017, but i'll say and i want to be clear that the $1.4 billion is all opex. that's an opex savings number that we think we get to by mid-2017.\n","perfect, and for the follow-up, asps on the client server up 19%. just talk about how much of that was potentially cpu improvements on notebook and desktop pricing versus the lower mobility that may have had a better part to play there?\n","so just to recap the financial data that we provided you, we get to that level by mid-2017, that's $1.4 billion in savings, and that is a net number, so that's including some reinvestment that we plan to make. we think that's 12,000 positions that get eliminated, which is a very difficult thing for us to go through, but that's what's in these numbers. we think we achieve half of those employment reductions by the end of this year.\n","great, thanks for the insights there. and then on the memory solutions group, i mean that's a business that grew 20% last year. i think it was up year-over-year every single quarter last year. obviously it was down in q1. you mentioned aggressive price declines.\n","\n","hello.\n","sure.\n","and so what this effort around the restructuring is, is to say, it's time now to try, and we've made enough progress, right?\n","and the one that stacy and i have been working for several months, actually several quarters, on what does he do next, how do we growth his both exposure to other parts of the company and also the rest of the company see his leadership style.\n","this is going to be an orderly transition.\n","my follow-up would be the full-year guidance of mid single-digit growth.\n","what we're projecting for the year is overall growth, and we think we'll see growth in the data center, growth in iot, growth in memory that's offsetting some, oh and of course we've added in altera now into our product family, and so you take that and that's offsetting some of the weakness that we're seeing in the pc market.\n","great, thank you.\n","you know, we think that we can become more focused.\n","you did a great job explaining exactly why we believe that the data center will continue in double-digit growth this year.\n","we believe we have great products that we are introducing, with the broadwell lineup.\n","so what drives the acceleration from the q1 decline?\n","sure, so let me start and then we can just talk about, remember the majority of our memory space is built into ssds that are going into the data center, so you call those, really those higher-end performance class systems.\n","we think we've done a very good job of structuring the business that we ride through these with a high degree of confidence.\n","if i look forward, we believe the 3d nand technology that we're just beginning to ramp in our factories today, and we're building out the dalian factory for later this year startup, gives us a real cost advantage in this space and will allow us to even be more profitable in even these kinds of environments.\n","thanks for taking my questions.\n","for my follow-up, i just wanted to touch on channel inventory.\n","so, you had your notebook and desktop volumes down low single digits year-over-year.\n","yes, so i would point to two things relative to the overall, what we saw from our customers.\n","they would see a weaker quarter, and i think that's because they were catching up to our view of the market and bringing inventory levels down.\n","okay, thanks.\n","when you look at those two items, the majority of what we're spending the capex on, 10 nanometer and memory?\n","but if you take a look inside any one of those segments, asps are increasing, and our forecast for the overall segment for the year is an increasing asp.\n","and stacy, you talked about in your opening comments, the 14-nanometer ramp starting to hit there.\n","so it doesn't cause us to being a different space from overall operating profit percent.\n","i'm curious, in lieu of the restructuring, how you're thinking about the pc market longer-term.\n","that's allowing us to invest even more in those growth areas.\n","and then we're continuing to gain share in segments like set-top boxes, which are becoming more and more pc-like with our capabilities, if you think about it from a hardware standpoint.\n","could you just talk about, from the restructuring cost perspective, how much of that is going to be cash versus non cash, and would all the cash outlays happen in the back half of this year?\n","what we're trying to do is really provide top of rack to bottom of rack solutions, that bring -- that work together and bring performance across the whole rack.\n","but i'll give you some insight into how brian and i are thinking of this.\n","this year we believe we are at 62%, so that continues.\n","i don't see anything on the horizon that changes that in the near term.\n","and then with these actions that we're taking, when we get to full realization, and i want to stress, we do believe that this will give us an opportunity to reinvest in the business and actually accelerate growth, but if you just look at the cost side of it, it's 2 to 3 points of spending as a percent of revenue when we get to mid-2017, and full realization.\n","chris danely, citigroup.\n","now let's talk about iot.\n","they don't tend to be cell phone chips.\n","but that link also between those products in iot and 5g, and the 5g infrastructure, we believe also plays into the data center, and the whole data center strategy, and will be critical that you can provide end-to-end solutions.\n","and then the other part is we would expect to have a higher proportion of our profit in lower tax jurisdictions as we work our way through the year.\n","yes, i'm sure that as we go through this and we finish the project evaluation, there will be some products that we'll exit from, those as they're defined.\n","it has not touched that at all.\n","as far as moore's law, we are always constantly striving to get back to two years.\n","more importantly what i always remind people is the leadership you have over the competition, which is always what's important, right?\n","both of those are as important as the other.\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install evaluate
