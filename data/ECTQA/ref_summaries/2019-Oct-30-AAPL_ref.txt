<sync id="l201"time="00:31:13"/>iphone revenue trajectory did improve, but it still declined 9%.
<sync id="l213"time="00:32:24"/>yes.
<sync id="l217"time="00:32:47"/>on the other side, foreign exchange for us continues to be probably the biggest headwind that we got right now.
<sync id="l245"time="00:36:07"/>yes.
<sync id="l267"time="00:38:21"/>the other thing that is obviously happening is in many areas, the arpu is increasing.
<sync id="l276"time="00:39:15"/>is there a sense or a way to think about what's the attach rate today to ios devices for apple watch or airpods?
<sync id="l282"time="00:40:13"/>we got a lot left there.
<sync id="l303"time="00:42:04"/>but we feel good about how we're doing.
<sync id="l321"time="00:43:46"/>in some cases, our revenue growth exceeds our opex growth.
<sync id="l347"time="00:47:06"/>the portfolio of services also has incredible momentum.
<sync id="l350"time="00:47:45"/>okay.
<sync id="l354"time="00:48:06"/>and i'm wondering if you view this as kind of a strategic advantage of apple and whether we might see more hardware plus services offerings -- bundled offerings.
<sync id="l361"time="00:49:31"/>so we use all these things to make assumptions around what the take rate is going to be.
<sync id="l368"time="00:50:24"/>so it's not part of a broader pattern or -- although i wouldn't want to rule out for the future that we might not see another opportunity at some point in time.
<sync id="l373"time="00:51:23"/>and so we're cognizant that there are lots of users out there that want sort of a recurring payment like that and the receipt of new products on some sort of standard kind of basis.
<sync id="l377"time="00:52:00"/>thank you.
<sync id="l386"time="00:52:55"/>and i think we've got the best lineup we've ever had, and the customer response to the product, what the product does for them is really incredible.
<sync id="l395"time="00:54:19"/>as a follow-on, perhaps you could talk about the potential for some of the tariffs that are upcoming.
<sync id="l413"time="00:57:01"/>great.
<sync id="l419"time="00:57:45"/>and so there's still a very, very large new to apple watch in this regard.
