<sync id="l162"/>thank you.
<sync id="l170"/>the way that we participate in the sort of the changes that are going on in the media industry that i fully expect to accelerate from sort of the cable bundle beginning to break down is one, we started the new apple tv a year ago, and we're pleased with how that platform has come along.
<sync id="l183"/>we look at it, those are the two key elements for us.
<sync id="l192"/>your numbers actually look fairly impressive in greater china, china specifically.
<sync id="l215"/>so what gets you there?
<sync id="l226"/>and so as we look, as i was explaining earlier, as we look at the number of people that transact growing double digits, we see the amount spent per paid account growing so well, we think that the app store is going to be a significant driver of growth.
<sync id="l236"/>we said it many times, in aggregate, our services business tends to have margins that are above company averages.
<sync id="l247"/>i mentioned that foreign exchange is a significant headwind for us, both at the revenue level and at the gross margin level.
<sync id="l259"/>can you talk about the puts and takes in gross margins in the quarter please?
<sync id="l260"/>sure.
<sync id="l266"/>again keep in mind the strong dollar that doesn't help us on that front.
<sync id="l283"/>we did have an exceptional quarter with iphone, and that was with the back drop of not predicting the demand very well in the iphone 7 plus and therefore being in constraint on it through the quarter.
<sync id="l284"/>if you look at the absolute number of upgraders, it was the highest that we've seen in any quarter.
<sync id="l290"/>as your comps get easier this year, i was curious if you think you're going to be returning to growth in that region?
<sync id="l291"/>and then just to give us the context i know you talked about the 6% constant currency increase in revenue in mainland china, but curious if you strip out the double digit increase in ipad and macbook and potentially the mix shift to the 7 plus, curious what underlying iphone units did in mainland china?
<sync id="l299"/>can we have the next question please?
<sync id="l302"/>i just wanted to better understand the upgrade rate dynamics.
<sync id="l332"/>tim, i have a question for you.
<sync id="l337"/>i don't like litigation and view it as a last resort.
<sync id="l345"/>in terms of where it goes, we'll see.
<sync id="l355"/>first i wanted to ask about the ipad.
<sync id="l361"/>in this quarter we decreased by 700.
<sync id="l382"/>i think its become -- every year it becomes more important to people's lives, and there's more things people are doing with it.
<sync id="l384"/>and so when i look at all of these things, usage going up, app developers still innovating, we've got some exciting things in the pipeline, i feel really, really good about it.
