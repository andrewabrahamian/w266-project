<sync id="l187"time="00:31:25"/>clearly, we expect to have continued strong growth from the non-iphone categories.
<sync id="l193"time="00:32:03"/>keep in mind that the guidance includes an estimated almost $1 billion of foreign exchange headwind for the quarter.
<sync id="l194"time="00:32:11"/>fair enough.
<sync id="l226"time="00:35:46"/>we had double-digit growth on the app store in every geography.
<sync id="l247"time="00:38:23"/>great.
<sync id="l282"time="00:42:24"/>and then i have a follow-up.
<sync id="l283"time="00:42:27"/>it's tim.
<sync id="l287"time="00:42:41"/>and trade-in, as a percentage of their total sales, is significant and financing is a key element of it.
<sync id="l303"time="00:44:24"/>but more broadly, to answer your question about growth as we go forward, the way i see it is we have the strongest hardware portfolio ever.
<sync id="l307"time="00:44:54"/>the installed base is growing, hit a new record.
<sync id="l308"time="00:44:57"/>that's obviously good.
<sync id="l325"time="00:46:42"/>and so we're focusing on products and services and there will be some services that aren't hooked and some that are hooked not on current period sales are mostly -- very much services are rarely connected on that today or at least not a high percentage by any means.
<sync id="l332"time="00:47:57"/>and i have a follow-up.
<sync id="l347"time="00:49:44"/>yes, wamsi.
<sync id="l368"time="00:51:47"/>installed base is a function of upgrades and the time between those.
<sync id="l378"time="00:53:22"/>i don't want to go into the specific numbers, but i think you can see readily, mathematically, how the installed base is growing in an environment where the iphone revenue is declining within a 90-day kind of window.
<sync id="l388"time="00:54:39"/>we talked about a lot of new services that we are launching during the fall and apple card the next month.
<sync id="l389"time="00:54:48"/>obviously, they will require the appropriate level of marketing and advertising as we launch them to the general public.
<sync id="l403"time="00:56:54"/>if i can just follow up on the china market.
<sync id="l404"time="00:57:02"/>one of the things that we're looking at is with these -- going into the new year into 2020, there'll be a lot of 5g phones launching in that market from the android players.
<sync id="l406"time="00:57:18"/>we don't comment on future products.
<sync id="l418"time="00:58:55"/>thank you for your participation.
