<sync id="l166"time="00:27:21"/>and then i have a follow-up.
<sync id="l169"time="00:27:35"/>what it means to us as a company, of course, is that we have additional flexibility right now from the access to the foreign cash.
<sync id="l186"time="00:30:02"/>the iphone x was the most popular, and that's particularly noteworthy, given that we didn't start shipping until early november and were constrained for a while.
<sync id="l190"time="00:30:38"/>and so we feel fantastic about the results.
<sync id="l196"time="00:31:28"/>now if you look at the sort of the overall iphone line, which gets to the essence of the question i think, i looked -- i reviewed the top mini markets.
<sync id="l202"time="00:32:34"/>growing double digits off such a large revenue base is impressive in itself, but if i look at march quarter guidance, it does assume a slower average weekly growth in total revenue as well as, i think, on my math, iphone shipments when you compare it to the december quarter.
<sync id="l208"time="00:33:24"/>it's strong double-digit growth, 13% to 17%.
<sync id="l226"time="00:36:07"/>so in summary, our guidance for iphone, we got double-digit year-over-year growth and acceleration of sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis.
<sync id="l232"time="00:36:49"/>and so if you can just comment on how you think that flows into the model over the next couple of quarters, the weaker dollar, and what your outlook might be around component costs in the near future.
<sync id="l245"time="00:38:52"/>how do you think about that going forward?
<sync id="l260"time="00:40:14"/>we put a lot of energy on ar.
<sync id="l267"time="00:40:56"/>you commented on how your installed base over the last couple of years has grown 30%.
<sync id="l269"time="00:41:06"/>and so iphone installed base is probably growing close to that number, perhaps less, call it 20% or 25%.
<sync id="l275"time="00:42:18"/>i think it's up to investors as to what things they would like to focus on, so i don't want to put myself in a position of that.
<sync id="l292"time="00:44:53"/>okay.
<sync id="l304"time="00:46:01"/>and i think we're going to be receiving, over the next few months, implementation guidance.
<sync id="l305"time="00:46:06"/>so we've taken some provisional estimates in coming up with our tax entries for the quarter.
<sync id="l333"time="00:49:11"/>i think you're asking, are there more active users today than there were 2 years ago when we had 1 billion active devices?
<sync id="l335"time="00:49:24"/>there are many, many, many more.
<sync id="l345"time="00:50:21"/>okay.
<sync id="l364"time="00:52:36"/>what category is it in?
<sync id="l373"time="00:53:57"/>it also -- obviously, you can also do things with homepod like use it as a speakerphone.
<sync id="l389"time="00:55:33"/>and so even though we're recording a similar year-over-year growth for greater china, if you change that reporting to an average weekly sales, which is probably a much better way to look at it, there was actually a really nice acceleration.
<sync id="l405"time="00:57:20"/>and does this change your thoughts around m&a at all?
<sync id="l406"time="00:57:24"/>and is that one reason, you get that number from $163 billion to 0?
<sync id="l411"time="00:57:49"/>during -- in calendar 2017, we've acquired 19 companies.
<sync id="l413"time="00:58:15"/>so it's always the customer experience in mind, right, that we make acquisitions.
<sync id="l420"time="00:59:02"/>so we'll see.
<sync id="l433"time="01:00:18"/>thank you for your participation.
