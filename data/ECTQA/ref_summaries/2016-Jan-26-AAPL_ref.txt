<sync id="l168"/>just in terms of your march quarter guidance, it does imply a double digit decline at the midpoint.
<sync id="l182"/>but inevitably over time, higher prices affect demand and so we are capturing that in our guidance.
<sync id="l189"/>tim, could you talk a little bit about the iphone upgrade program and the theme of iphone as a subscription?
<sync id="l198"/>and so we see that as a huge opportunity.
<sync id="l200"/>in terms of the upgrade program itself, i think over time, it will be meaningful as customers get into a different pattern.
<sync id="l204"/>in terms of virtual reality, no, i don't think it's a niche.
<sync id="l221"/>we had great reception for the new iphones that we launched at the end of september.
<sync id="l222"/>of course, we have a very strong mid tier this year in the portfolio, with 6 and 6 plus.
<sync id="l223"/>but overall,  when you look at the outcome during the december quarter, it was very, very strong.
<sync id="l239"/>and the data center capacity that we put in place is to provide the services that are tied to the installed base.
<sync id="l247"/>i have a question, a follow-up, please.
<sync id="l249"/>and i'd like you to address that question, because the obvious follow-up questions are is that because you believe the smartphone market won't grow or because apple may be reaching saturation in the market?
<sync id="l256"/>we believe it's the toughest compare because of the year ago quarter also had catch up in it from q1.
<sync id="l272"/>and then i'm not sure if i misheard you,  but i think you said your total installed base grew 25% year-over-year.
<sync id="l280"/>and then we are showing that on that portion of installed base-driven services business, there is a part that is related to -- where we recognize revenue in terms of the full transaction value.
<sync id="l293"/>i had a question about gross margin.
<sync id="l301"/>i think when you say ip licensing, you mean this patent dispute that was resolved.
<sync id="l311"/>i know you said you want to invest while there's great opportunity in china and all of that.
<sync id="l327"/>we'll hear from steve milunovich with ubs.
<sync id="l328"/>steve, are you there?
<sync id="l353"/>india's growth, as you know, is very good.
<sync id="l357"/>the median age there is 27.
<sync id="l369"/>great.
<sync id="l372"/>could we have the next question, please?
<sync id="l374"/>thank you.
<sync id="l376"/>you talk a lot about the macroeconomic weakness weighing on units, but is some of the issue just that last year replacement got accelerated and this year it's kind of normalizing, and that's kind of a one-time headwind in terms of the unit growth that you see in that business.
<sync id="l421"/>okay.
<sync id="l430"/>some change the way they go to market.
<sync id="l434"/>just because it seems like growing that installed base and services, as you pointed out, really economically could really help out apple in the long term.
<sync id="l437"/>and i assume it's all one-time this quarter you recorded it, it's all gross margin, and we don't cause that to reoccur again going forward.
<sync id="l446"/>we design a great product and we make it priced at a great value.
<sync id="l449"/>as i said earlier, it's worth 40 basis points.
