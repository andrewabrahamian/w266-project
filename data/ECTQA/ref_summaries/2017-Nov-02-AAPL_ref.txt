and then, i have a follow-up.
okay.
the -- we increased market share for iphone, mac and ipad during the quarter.
we hit all-time revenue records for services and for mac in the -- for the prc during the quarter.
i'm just trying to understand, because you have such a broader lineup than you've had in prior years.
but we've put our absolutely best thinking that we have here in the guidance that luca presented.
and you can tell from that, that we're bullish.
steve milunovich with ubs.
obviously, i'm not going to talk about mix.
and so we'll see what happens there.
and so if you think about that, that's a few coffees a week.
the other thing to keep in mind is that many people are now trading in their current iphone on the next iphone.
and so that even reduces the monthly payment less.
and iphone x has a lot of great new technologies in there that are leading the industry, and it is a fabulous product and we can't wait for people to start getting it in their hands.
now, though, you're leading in ar.
just following up a little bit on that question, tim.
toni, i'll take that one.
when -- you said, we price our products for the value that we deliver.
we also said that every time we launch new products, the cost structures of the new products tend to be higher than the products that they replace.
we are adding new technologies, new features.
we have a case right now around memory pricing, which is a headwind for the time being.
so there's many puts and takes that we tend to think about maximizing gross margin dollars.
and then, i wanted to revisit this notion of supply and demand.
we're -- just sold the first units minutes ago.
but you had mentioned great success in india, i believe, tim.
it's building stores.
and i feel like we're making good progress there and are gaining understanding of the market, but we still have a long way to go.
i don't -- which i sort of see as an opportunity instead of a problem.
i think it's all of those things.
that's really helpful.
as i mentioned, particularly on the app store, which is very important to us, the number of paying accounts has grown a lot.
and as you correctly point out, our growth rate is accelerating.
i don't know when yet.
so if you had to -- what would you attribute that to?
and as i've indicated before, the china rebound was broad-based across the products.
