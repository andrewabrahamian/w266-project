<sync id="l191"time="00:29:35"/>services growth did decelerate from the growth rates in recent quarters.
<sync id="l204"time="00:30:46"/>as we just told you, the installed base continues to grow very nicely.
<sync id="l219"time="00:32:38"/>we're also broadening the scope of many of these services.
<sync id="l256"time="00:37:30"/>and so we will continue to execute the program.
<sync id="l265"time="00:38:29"/>the iphone xs max, which was new, was $100 more than the xs.
<sync id="l272"time="00:39:56"/>and then secondly, in some markets as i had talked about in my prepared remarks, the subsidy is probably the bigger of the issues in the developed markets.
<sync id="l277"time="00:41:02"/>well, steve, we did mention on the call last quarter that the different timing of our phone launches would affect the year-over-year compares.
<sync id="l286"time="00:42:27"/>it also implies a year-over-year deceleration in iphone revenues.
<sync id="l289"time="00:42:52"/>i mean, 3 questions there.
<sync id="l292"time="00:43:06"/>we've done pretty well with that up until the december quarter, right?
<sync id="l296"time="00:43:19"/>we believe that this is the range where we're going to fall within.
<sync id="l301"time="00:44:13"/>on a year-over-year basis, the negative impact from currency is going to be about $1.3 billion, so that's about -- a bit more than 2 points versus last year's revenue.
<sync id="l317"time="00:46:46"/>and so that's the way that we look at it.
<sync id="l325"time="00:47:24"/>i think you've seen that services gross margins increased on a year-over-year basis by a significant amount.
<sync id="l345"time="00:49:47"/>so perhaps when this comes out, you'll be multiplatform.
<sync id="l376"time="00:53:11"/>in the past, that deferral and the subsequent amortization was reported under products.
<sync id="l379"time="00:53:34"/>we just report that estimated value under the services category.
<sync id="l385"time="00:54:02"/>got it.
<sync id="l399"time="00:55:32"/>during the last 3 years, we've added apple pay, which has been incredibly successful and is a wonderful customer experience.
<sync id="l402"time="00:55:51"/>we provide an advertising service for developers on the app store.
<sync id="l403"time="00:55:56"/>the way we've added these services in the past, obviously, we're also very interested in adding new services that can provide great value to our customers in the future.
<sync id="l416"time="00:57:09"/>thank you for your participation.
