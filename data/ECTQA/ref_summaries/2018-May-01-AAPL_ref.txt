and that's how we feel about it.
then, i have a follow-up.
the -- services grew 31%.
i'd be curious what the next drivers of services revenue are?
well, mike, it's tim.
the -- again, the great thing about services is there are several services that make up the total that are growing nicely.
this year, we're -- we're not going to release this number every quarter, but we've obviously grown again.
i guess, what's driving that?
we also -- more broadly on the iphone, the iphone was the top 3 selling phones in china.
yes.
on a year-over-year basis, it's less relevant for our business, but in general, i would say that this year we are seeing a more difficult cost environment.
and how does this ongoing debate around data protection translate into a positive for apple over time?
but when it comes down between dividends and buyback, our view is that for a variety of reasons, the -- we see a lot of value in the stock.
could that potentially broaden out?
yes, good question.
on the market side, we've seen iphone x, as i had mentioned before, as being the top-selling smartphone during the quarter.
and it's #1 in china, which is another powerful point.
but the way we think about it is trying to price a reasonable price for the value that we deliver, and i feel that we did that.
i think we've been able to navigate a difficult foreign exchange environment for a number of years.
yet when we do our analysis, we kind of still see emerging markets like india and all those still a growth.
and then, luca, the question for you is about the gross margin.
in terms of the iphone itself, even though we sell quite a few phones across the course of a year, our market share globally is low compared to the -- our sales are low compared to the full market of smartphones.
jim, on the gross margin side, i think i'll repeat what i said earlier, but we -- you're right.
at the same time, within the services portfolio that we have, we have services that have different levels of profitability, so we also need to take into account the mix of services that we're going to be selling.
