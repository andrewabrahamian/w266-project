<sync id="l173"time="00:27:35"/>and so when you compound these 2 things with the financing and the trade-in, it makes the product super affordable.
<sync id="l189"time="00:29:49"/>iphone 11 is still the most popular smartphone, but iphone se definitely helped our results.
<sync id="l203"time="00:31:42"/>4 years ago, you made a great prediction that services is going to be $50 billion by 2020.
<sync id="l223"time="00:33:43"/>and then i have a follow-up.
<sync id="l225"time="00:33:46"/>shannon, the growth that -- we did see growth in greater china for the quarter of 2%.
<sync id="l234"time="00:35:04"/>great.
<sync id="l249"time="00:37:12"/>and so when you combine the -- a strong cycle plus an iphone se launch plus the reopening of the stores, et cetera, i think there were a lot of things that were going in the right direction there.
<sync id="l252"time="00:37:32"/>and i guess, luca, if i could just follow up with you.
<sync id="l261"time="00:38:31"/>so obviously, that is something to keep in mind.
<sync id="l282"time="00:41:30"/>and this is things like the financing and the trade-in programs that you mentioned.
<sync id="l285"time="00:41:43"/>great.
<sync id="l293"time="00:42:28"/>there's clearly -- as we had indicated, there's some amount of work from home and remote learning that do affect the results of mac and ipad positively.
<sync id="l310"time="00:44:40"/>well, on the opex front, there have been obviously certain things that have been affected in terms of cost reductions.
<sync id="l331"time="00:47:16"/>i understand within services, there's a pretty wide range of gross margins by business, and i'm wondering if that should continue to improve.
<sync id="l339"time="00:48:26"/>so the relative success of our products and services in the marketplace will drive, to a certain extent, what our margins are.
<sync id="l349"time="00:49:51"/>i was -- we did come out sort of the way we told you last quarter.
<sync id="l352"time="00:50:04"/>so we wound up being very pleased with how we did, but the store closures definitely affect the wearables and the iphone.
<sync id="l354"time="00:50:31"/>and i have 2 questions.
<sync id="l362"time="00:51:19"/>was that for like iphone, iphone chips or product launches?
<sync id="l369"time="00:52:03"/>and so we'll see.
<sync id="l378"time="00:53:11"/>and have you seen any change in the buying behavior of apple card users in terms of accelerating spend on more apple products and services?
<sync id="l399"time="00:55:48"/>thank you again for joining us.
