<sync id="l189"time="00:29:31"/>if you look at -- i'll start with china.
<sync id="l193"time="00:29:52"/>we closed our stores in february.
<sync id="l198"time="00:30:21"/>and if you look at kind of where we are today, we've seen further improvement in april as compared to march.
<sync id="l215"time="00:32:59"/>yes.
<sync id="l217"time="00:33:05"/>so we know that the core of the business, the core of the company is innovation and product and services development, so we will continue to invest in our pipeline.
<sync id="l232"time="00:35:08"/>and so as you can tell, along with everything else going on, we were able to launch and ship the iphone se, the ipad pro with the magic keyboard and the macbook air.
<sync id="l234"time="00:35:32"/>and so we're continuing to work.
<sync id="l241"time="00:36:30"/>but i was wondering, would you consider using the strength of your balance sheet maybe a little differently structured, maybe deferred payments or things like that?
<sync id="l256"time="00:38:29"/>i think there are things from just a great reminder of how important our products are and -- for remote work.
<sync id="l263"time="00:39:41"/>and so you will see us continue on that.
<sync id="l275"time="00:40:52"/>the $50 billion is in addition to over $40 billion that is still remaining from the past authorization that we've received from our board, right?
<sync id="l285"time="00:41:57"/>and so also on the m&a front, nothing has changed.
<sync id="l303"time="00:43:58"/>yes.
<sync id="l332"time="00:47:31"/>the other business which we think is going to be impacted by the overall economic weakness and the uncertainty on when businesses will reopen is advertising, which is the sum of our advertising business on the app store, on apple news and the third-party agreements that we have on the advertising front.
<sync id="l333"time="00:47:56"/>so these are 2 things that, during the june quarter, will create a headwind for the services business.
<sync id="l354"time="00:50:59"/>and then in march, as stores reopened, we -- the recovery began, and then we've seen further recovery in april.
<sync id="l355"time="00:51:09"/>where that goes, we will see, but that's kind of what we've seen so far there.
<sync id="l365"time="00:52:41"/>and if i can just follow up on your previous comment about the strong demand you're seeing for iphone se, just given the price point, i'm wondering if you're expecting any change in terms of the geographic mix of where the demand comes from relative to typically what you see for other iphones in the lineup just given the lower price point.
<sync id="l367"time="00:53:18"/>and so we'll see how that plays out.
<sync id="l385"time="00:55:45"/>for march, chris, we saw nand pricing increase slightly, while dram and displays and the other commodities declined.
<sync id="l395"time="00:57:03"/>thank you again for joining us.
