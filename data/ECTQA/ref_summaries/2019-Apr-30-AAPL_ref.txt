<sync id="l208"time="00:31:41"/>tim, can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing in china?
<sync id="l219"time="00:32:46"/>the -- there's stimulus programs that the government has executed, including, and this happened in early april, vat being reduced from 16% to 13%, so they've been aggressive in the stimulus side.
<sync id="l220"time="00:33:05"/>three, our trade-in and financing programs that we implemented in our retail stores have been very well received there, and i'm happy with the results to date there.
<sync id="l226"time="00:33:52"/>how are you thinking about your component providers going forward?
<sync id="l242"time="00:35:46"/>how much of that incremental is going in to support the new services that you're planning to launch later in the year?
<sync id="l243"time="00:35:53"/>yes.
<sync id="l259"time="00:37:59"/>we're also expecting a relative improvement in our iphone performance on a year-over-year basis in q3 versus the first half.
<sync id="l265"time="00:39:40"/>and the -- certainly, from a cost point of view, there has been -- the technologies have had cost pressure over the last couple of years or so.
<sync id="l288"time="00:43:44"/>and what -- the experience that we've had in a few of these emerging markets has been positive in that respect, and so that's what we think matters the most really.
<sync id="l300"time="00:45:21"/>and so it's really all over the place.
<sync id="l301"time="00:45:23"/>in terms of the incentives, we're offering currently in our retail stores a trade-in value that has -- that is more than the sort of the blue book of the device, if you will, for lack of a better description.
<sync id="l310"time="00:47:23"/>and does your guidance contemplate incremental pricing actions that could be creating some gross margin headwinds?
<sync id="l320"time="00:48:39"/>and then i have a follow-up.
<sync id="l344"time="00:51:29"/>we think that most users are going to get multiple over-the-top products, and we're going to do our best to convince them that the apple tv+ product should be one of them.
<sync id="l354"time="00:52:34"/>but what's the -- obviously, the potential could be huge, but the market already seems to be pretty dominated on the android side.
