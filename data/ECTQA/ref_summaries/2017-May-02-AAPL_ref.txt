<sync id="l180"time="00:27:16"/>and the fact that our services mix increases as we go through the year, that is, of course, also helping given the profile of our gross margin for services.
<sync id="l182"time="00:27:32"/>as we move into the june quarter, as you know, we tend to have some level of gross margin compression as we go from the march quarter to the june quarter.
<sync id="l185"time="00:27:59"/>and the cost pressures on memory will remain.
<sync id="l193"time="00:29:05"/>as you noted in your remarks, the iphone 7 plus demand it's selling incredibly well, and this is a product that was pretty severely supply constrained in the december quarter.
<sync id="l207"time="00:31:04"/>anything you can provide, and then i have a follow-up.
<sync id="l210"time="00:31:09"/>we saw in q2 the -- a performance that, combined with q1 and that formed the first half of the year, was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year.
<sync id="l213"time="00:31:48"/>the mac revenue growth was up 20% in china, and we had extremely strong services growth during the quarter in china.
<sync id="l225"time="00:33:52"/>and we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there.
<sync id="l228"time="00:34:18"/>so i'm curious as to -- given some of the commentary that's come out of the administration, which i think most companies were expecting some sort of return, how do you generally think about what you need to run the business from a cash perspective, how you think about the balance sheet from a, i don't know, strength perspective, just as we look forward to what hopefully will come through?
<sync id="l243"time="00:36:14"/>and i think you had made a comment, tim, in your prepared remarks that the average revenue per user is up, or maybe that was you, luca.
<sync id="l253"time="00:37:07"/>it's a large number.
<sync id="l258"time="00:37:46"/>we see that the number of paying accounts is growing a lot.
<sync id="l272"time="00:40:17"/>from ubs, steve milunovich.
<sync id="l275"time="00:40:31"/>it had what seems to be a very good quarter, and ironically, the competition almost seems to be fading in that part of the market right now.
<sync id="l289"time="00:42:18"/>and so as i look at that, that's pretty fast to come that far.
<sync id="l297"time="00:43:17"/>but we're very committed to it and believe that -- it's already a big business and believe over time it will be even larger.
<sync id="l305"time="00:44:18"/>and so that part is clearly going on, and it could be what's behind the data.
<sync id="l318"time="00:46:41"/>in terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount.
<sync id="l323"time="00:47:19"/>but right now we're depending upon the courts to do that, and so that is the thinking.
<sync id="l324"time="00:47:26"/>the reason that we're pursuing this is that qualcomm's trying to charge apple a percentage of the total iphone value, and they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it's one small part of what an iphone is.
<sync id="l326"time="00:47:59"/>and so we don't think that's right.
<sync id="l331"time="00:48:28"/>if i try and adjust for the drawdown in inventory and the extra week last quarter, i think sequentially, iphones declined about 27% if i make those adjustments.
<sync id="l358"time="00:53:34"/>but as hopefully you've seen, as we began to give you more information about india, we've been investing quite a bit.
<sync id="l365"time="00:54:46"/>that's great.
