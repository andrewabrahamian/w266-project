<sync id="l185"time="00:29:44"/>services mix is rising.
<sync id="l194"time="00:30:27"/>and the app store, applecare, apple music, cloud services, apple pay all set new june quarter records.
<sync id="l197"time="00:30:47"/>in terms of the next leg of this, we're -- given the momentum that we're seeing across the board, we feel great about our current services.
<sync id="l201"time="00:31:37"/>starting with the june quarter, typically, we see a decline in gross margin going from the march quarter to the june quarter.
<sync id="l213"time="00:33:20"/>looking forward, you know we don't provide guidance beyond the current quarter, but i think we have a pretty good record over the last several years to make good business decisions, balancing units, revenue and margins.
<sync id="l224"time="00:34:58"/>yes.
<sync id="l232"time="00:36:50"/>if you look at it on a geographic basis, the top 3 selling phones in urban china were iphone, where iphone x was #1 and has been for a couple of quarters.
<sync id="l240"time="00:38:05"/>yes, it's a good question.
<sync id="l247"time="00:38:43"/>in terms of the tariffs themselves, maybe i could sort of take a step back because i'm sure that a lot -- some people have questions on this.
<sync id="l257"time="00:40:42"/>there is a fourth tariff, which includes goods valued at $200 billion, also focused on goods that are imported from china.
<sync id="l262"time="00:41:32"/>and so we're going through that now, and we'll be sharing our results later on those and feeding back from the comment.
<sync id="l266"time="00:42:25"/>each country can only prosper if the other does.
<sync id="l278"time="00:43:53"/>and we think that we can do some great original content together, and so we could not be happier in working with oprah.
<sync id="l297"time="00:48:10"/>our revenues on apple music grew over 50%, as i'd mentioned earlier, during the quarter.
<sync id="l304"time="00:48:59"/>i know you provided some commentary last quarter on how we should be thinking about q3 asps.
<sync id="l307"time="00:49:18"/>and the guidance range implies growth of 16% to 19%.
<sync id="l315"time="00:50:28"/>and i'm wondering if you can comment on, a, whether you believe that and what you think might be happening with replacement cycles and specifically also what impact, if any, you've seen from wider availability and less expensive replacement batteries for iphones.
<sync id="l322"time="00:51:39"/>and if you look at the sort of this cycle, which i'll define as q1, q2, q3 for ease, you'll see that we've grown like mid-single digits and -- on an average weekly sales point of view and, of course, double-digit on asp.
<sync id="l327"time="00:52:47"/>and i think that iphone x shows that when you deliver great innovative product, there's enough people there that would like that, and it can be a really good business.
<sync id="l338"time="00:54:16"/>yes.
<sync id="l352"time="00:55:47"/>home is important.
<sync id="l364"time="00:56:32"/>the question i have is, are they actually on-ramped into the apple ecosystem, the beats, the watch, the airpods, subscriptions?
<sync id="l370"time="00:57:41"/>and so in my view, this is a part of the -- they are a core part of the ecosystem.
<sync id="l374"time="00:58:09"/>and so the apple watch led them to the iphone.
<sync id="l379"time="00:58:46"/>all right.
<sync id="l381"time="00:58:48"/>thank you for the questions.
