i'm just curious as to how you're thinking about where you're putting your investment dollars for more of an acquisition or a potential equity stake standpoint as you look at overall capital allocation?
and so, overall commodity prices we expect to decline at, at least historical rates
thank you shannon.
next question, please?
so, what can you tell us about the timing of the new iphone model?
is that affecting this?
you mentioned the 451 is finding business interest in phones, but their survey on consumers actually finds the lowest level of expectation for purchases in the next three months since 2008.
you've seen the upgrade numbers from the carriers are quite low so it seems like it's still a very tough demand environment.
so, where is the strength coming from in the september quarter?
and so, that's the rationale for carplay.
thank you.
okay.
i see a switcher rate that is the highest ever.
i see lots of positive things so that's how i look at it.
when i look to your guidance for q4, i actually have the opposite question of a previous question which is in light of the true sell-through rate which seems to reflect better than normal seasonality in q3.
and, for total company revenues to be only fractionally up and below the kind of seasonality we see in q4.
you talked about the upgrade cycle and how it  is elongated relative to the iphone 6, and that it's similar to what you saw with the 5s.
and then, just more broadly, is apple thinking about ways to sell not only the iphone, but more of its products on a monthly-type subscription basis perhaps in a more bundled fashion so that you can add more predictability to what is now largely a transactional revenue model?
i also think that the deployment of ai technology is something that we will excel at because of our focus on user experience and so i like that.
some have a 24-month clock, and there are even some that have a 30-month clock  so, there's various time schedules there.
but, i'm sure that they will over time.
it also does show, as you point out, that ar can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this.
there's a tendency in this industry to call everything new the next computer platform.
we'll go to mark moskowitz with barclays.
clearly, a lot of momentum there over the last couple of years, but we're just trying to figure out how much of that is dedicated to existing products and services versus what's next?
we keep getting a lot of questions around se in terms of how cannibalistic could it be to the core iphone franchise?
and then, the other element was the fact that we've reduced more than 4 million units of channel inventory on the high end.
so, i don't want to be more precise than that, but you shouldn't look at what's there today and think we've done what we want to do.
