i can't speak about rumors, but as you know, we look for ways that we can improve the experience and the customers' experience on different sets of products, and we're always looking at new things.
thank you.
can we have the next question, please.
just trying to get at whether you see revenue, and in particular, iphone growth year on year on more of a sell-out basis when you adjust for those two factors.
and then, i have a follow-up.
and so, we're very much -- we're confidently investing in the future, and that's the reason you see the r&d spend increasing.
and so, when that upgrade rate in fy16 returned to a more normal upgrade rate, which would be akin to what we saw with the iphone 5s [as a point], it had further to fall.
great.
i don't mean like the smaller ones that you've done at a normal cadence, but there was clearly a fairly large one announced at least this week in the content world.
so, just if you can give an overall view of how you think about acquisitions that might be a little bit larger than normal?
you've talked in the past about television being an area of intense interest.
and so, it is an area that we're focused on.
when you look at our services revenue, the growth of the services revenues has been accelerating during the course of the year.
during a period when, as you know, our revenue came down slightly.
so, what that means in practice is that what we are seeing with our customers that consume our services is that the people that are actually taking advantage of our services, over time, they tend to spend more and more on our services.
it's not only with the app store but several categories that are growing very well for us.
but, i just am curious how you think about balancing ai with your focus on privacy.
i'm not making that point.
i don't think you're going to see the same impact going forward.
okay.
and then tim, some investors are antsy that apple has not acquired new profit pools or introduced a financially material new product in recent years.
the question is, a, does apple today have a grand strategy for what you want to do?
b, do you have any sense, we're kind of in a gap period where the technology and arguably what we've called the next job to be done haven't yet aligned?
and then, tim, for the clarification questions.
thanks for the question.
i'll let luca talk about the opex piece of it.
on india, i think it's important to look not only at per-capita income, which may be what you're looking at, but sort of look at the number of people that are or will move into the middle class over the next decade.
it's something that we've done very well over the years.
this is kind of the approach that we want to take and continue to take going forward.
we're guiding slightly higher for the december quarter because on the positive we're going to have, of course, better leverage and the mix in the december quarter tends to be better.
but, there's a couple of things that i think need to be considered before doing a year-over-year compare.
during the last two years the us dollar has appreciated by 15% over the basket of currencies where we do business.
your payout ratio is significantly below the s&p 500. i know you can't tell us what your intentions are here, but if you could help us understand how that thinking around the dividend works it would be great.
so, we have a robust discussion around the dividend and the buyback.
