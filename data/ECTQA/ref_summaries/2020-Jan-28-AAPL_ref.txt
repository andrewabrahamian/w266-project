how much of the growth do you think is coming from first-time buyers of airpods or apple watch versus folks that seem to be just upgrading the products that they have?
yes.
amit, it's tim.
so what are the offsets that's enabling what looks like a better-than-seasonal guide for gross margins?
on one side, we got the loss of leverage from the usual seasonality, but we expect that, that loss of leverage will be offset by better mix and cost savings.
the retail stores did fantastic on iphone, very strong double-digit growth in iphone from a year-over-year point of view.
we factored our best thinking in the guidance that we provided you.
with respect to supply sources that are outside the wuhan area, the impact is less clear at this time.
most commodities have been declining during the december quarter, and we expect the same to happen in the march quarter.
can we have the next question, please?
the 17% during the december quarter, we look at it against our fiscal year '19 growth rate, which was 16%, so we feel very good about the results for the december quarter.
i wouldn't want to conjecture about us in that business.
okay.
and there was also a contribution to revenue from the people, the subscribers that are actually paying for the service.
we'll hear from cowen and company's krish sankar.
there's a general view that when 5g phones come out, they're going to be more expensive due to higher component costs.
and then i have a follow-up for luca.
in other words, where will the average person kind of first feel the impact of ar on their lives in a significant way?
this is the reason i'm so excited about it, is you rarely have a new technology where business and consumer are both -- most see it as key to them.
and i think these things will happen in parallel.
but if you could talk about what's happening to the mix within iphone.
the customer response for iphone 11, 11 pro and 11 pro max has been exceptional, and that clearly has helped our mix.
i understand there are new investments that are happening now.
thank you.
so if i can just maybe then follow up in terms of, obviously, you've returned to growth in most of the regions you report.
